# Buddy-Council Plugin

A Codex plugin for multi-agent requirements/test-case analysis.

## What This Plugin Does

Buddy-Council helps teams detect contradictions, inconsistencies, and alignment gaps between **requirements** (from Jama or Excel) and **test cases** (from TestRail). It fetches data live — no RAG, no embeddings, no vector storage.

## Architecture

- **Commands** (`commands/`) — user-facing entry points (`/bc:contradiction`, `/bc:coverage`, `/bc:ask`, `/bc:setup`, `/bc:onboarding`, `/bc:validate`, `/bc:codemap`, `/bc:vnv-sprint-prep`, `/bc:automate`, `/bc:run-automation`)
- **Agents** (`agents/`) — reasoning engines that orchestrate skills to complete tasks
- **Skills** (`skills/`) — reusable capabilities (fetch data, normalize, analyze, enrich, map to code)
- **Providers** (`providers/`) — platform-specific data fetching instructions (TestRail, Excel, Jama, GitHub)
- **MCP Servers** (`mcp-servers/`) — standalone MCP servers wrapping external APIs (TestRail, Jama). **The TestRail server both reads and writes**: ten `testrail_get_*` read tools, plus `testrail_add_case`, `testrail_add_cases`, and `testrail_add_section`, which create cases and folders in the team's live instance. The hook's allowlist globs `testrail_get_*`, so a write tool must never be named `testrail_get_*`. Jama stays a read-only placeholder. GitHub access is handled either via the official external `github-mcp-server` (not vendored) or via the `gh` CLI. Jira/Confluence use **[`mcp-atlassian`](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian)** (`uvx mcp-atlassian@0.23.1`, stdio) — also not vendored: `/bc:setup` writes it into `.mcp.json` for Claude Code and `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` for Copilot CLI, both with absolute paths. Never vendor a Jira server again. It replaced Atlassian's hosted `mcp.atlassian.com` server in 0.21.1 for two reasons: the hosted one serves **Atlassian Cloud only**, so a Jira Server/Data Center team could never connect, and it exposes **no board or sprint tools**, which forced every board read to be faked with a project-wide JQL.
- **Config** (`config/`) — source selection and non-secret configuration

## Data Flow

```
Command → Agent → Skills (fetch → normalize → analyze) → Human-readable report
```

Requirements and test cases are fetched live from configured sources, normalized to a canonical schema, linked by ID references, then analyzed by Codex.

## Key Conventions

- All commands use the `bc:` prefix
- **README stays current**: any change that alters user-visible behavior — commands, the setup flow, the config schema, prerequisites, permissions, install or release steps — must update `README.md` in the same change set. A stale README is part of the bug, not a follow-up.
- **Commands are the only user-facing surface.** Skills are internal implementation details: every SKILL.md carries `user-invocable: false` (hides it from Claude Code's `/` menu) and a description starting with `Internal (used by /bc:…) —` so runtimes that still list skills (Copilot CLI) make the distinction obvious. Keep both markers when adding a skill.
- No hardcoded secrets — credentials live only in `~/.buddy-council/secrets.json` (gitignored, `chmod 600`), the single source of truth. `.mcp.json` is gitignored and holds no secrets — only non-secret env (`*_BASE_URL`) plus `BC_SECRETS_FILE` (the path the MCP servers read). The external GitHub MCP server is the lone exception (its token stays in `.mcp.json` env). **Jira is the one credential that does not live in `secrets.json`** — `mcp-atlassian` reads a dotenv file, so its token goes in `~/.buddy-council/atlassian.env` (`chmod 600`, same directory, same rules) and never into `secrets.json`, `.mcp.json`, or `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`. The MCP configs carry only the absolute `--env-file` path.
- **The `atlassian` server is registered by `/bc:setup`, in both runtime configs**: `.mcp.json` for Claude Code and `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` for Copilot CLI — exactly like `testrail`. **No plugin manifest declares it**, because a `uvx` server needs an absolute interpreter path and an absolute env-file path, and a committed manifest can hold neither. (Copilot could never use a manifest entry anyway: it doesn't merge plugin-declared MCP servers into its runtime config, [#2709](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/2709).)
- **MCP config is dual-file, like hooks**: Claude Code reads the project/plugin `.mcp.json`; Copilot CLI reads `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` and **ignores `.mcp.json` entirely**. `/bc:setup` writes both on every run, merging into the Copilot file rather than overwriting it. Copilot's schema additionally requires `type: "local"` and a `tools` allowlist per server, and neither file may rely on `PATH` or `~` expansion — `command` must be the absolute `uv` path and `BC_SECRETS_FILE` a fully expanded path, because the spawned server inherits neither.
- Source configuration lives in `.buddy-council/sources.json`
- Provider skills are swappable — adding a new platform means adding a `providers/<name>/` folder
- Agents never call providers directly — they go through router skills (`fetch-requirements`, `fetch-test-cases`, `fetch-board-issues`)
- **Data Contract**: every analysis command fetches **every configured source** — requirements and test cases always, plus GitHub doc enrichment whenever a `github_url` column is mapped and `requirements.enrichment.enabled` is true, plus **Jira board issues** whenever `jira.board` is configured and `jira.pending` is not true (scope narrows a fetch, never skips one). An unconfigured or still-`pending` board is *skipped with a visible line, not failed* — it does not make the run PARTIAL; a configured board that errors does. Each attempt is surfaced as a visible `Fetch:`/`Readiness:`/`Enrichment:` line, and if any configured source fails the agent stops and asks the user whether to continue with partial data — continuing marks the output **PARTIAL**. Tool calls are logged to `.buddy-council/logs/` by a bundled PostToolUse hook on **both runtimes**.
- **`/bc:vnv-sprint-prep` writes to other teams' tickets, so it is dry-run by default.** A plain run performs zero `jira_create_issue`/`jira_add_comment`/`jira_update_issue`/`jira_create_issue_link`/`jira_add_issues_to_sprint`/`testrail_add_cases`/`testrail_add_section` calls and prints a plan; `--apply` executes after one batch confirmation *per phase*. Never widen this: the auto-approve hook deliberately excludes every Jira write tool, and no `--allow-tool` recipe may list them.
- **`mcp-atlassian` cannot attach files** — `jira_download_attachments` has no upload counterpart, so V&V scenarios live in the ticket description instead of an attached `.md`. It **can** create issue links (`jira_create_issue_link`), so clones get a real Jira link *and* keep the `src-<DEV-KEY>` label: the label is what the duplicate guard searches on, since one board query beats a link traversal per issue. A site that refuses link creation degrades to label-only rather than failing the clone.
- **Hooks are dual-manifest**: `hooks/hooks.json` (Claude Code format) and the plugin-root `hooks.json` (Copilot CLI format, `version: 1`) register the same four scripts. The scripts are runtime-agnostic — they parse both payload shapes (`tool_name`/`tool_input` object vs `toolName`/`toolArgs` JSON-string) and emit both decision shapes (top-level `permissionDecision` for Copilot, `hookSpecificOutput` wrapper for Claude Code). Keep all of that intact when editing a hook, and never let a preToolUse script exit non-zero incidentally — Copilot treats that as deny (fail-closed). Copilot runs hook commands with cwd = the plugin dir, so project paths must come from `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`/`COPILOT_PROJECT_DIR` or the payload's `cwd`, never the process cwd.

## Available Commands

- `/bc:setup` — Configure data sources and credentials in four steps with a single review-and-save confirmation. Auto-guesses the Excel column mapping (one confirmation), auto-selects the GitHub enrichment strategy, and auto-detects the code project. Re-running shows the current config and only changes what you ask.
- `/bc:contradiction` — Detect contradictions between requirements and test cases
- `/bc:coverage` — Find untested requirements, orphan test cases, and coverage gaps
- `/bc:ask` — Natural language query — routes to the right agent or answers directly
- `/bc:onboarding` — Walk a new team member through the product feature-by-feature with paced demos, do/don't pairs from test cases, optional code mapping when run from inside a codebase, and an assessment phase. Progress is logged to `.buddy-council/onboarding-progress.json` in the user's project root and resumes across sessions.
- `/bc:validate` — Validate Jira tickets against requirements and test cases (gap and contradiction detection)
- `/bc:codemap "<feature>"` — Map a single feature to where it lives in the current codebase (files, communication flow, per-requirement locations). Same output as the onboarding code-mapping phase, invokable standalone.
- `/bc:automate <case>` — Write a TestRail case (link or ID) as an automated test in the team's automation framework, reusing its page objects and conventions, and compile it (no run). The framework checkout is located per machine (`--repo` → `$BC_AUTOMATION_ROOT` → cached `automation.framework_root` → cwd → common clone dirs, matched by git `origin` against `automation.repo_url` → offer to clone), never hardcoded. Writes framework files only after one confirmation; never commits or pushes. Framework specifics live in `providers/<name>/framework.md` (`testng-gradle` today).
- `/bc:run-automation <case>...` — Run the automated tests linked to one or more TestRail cases (found by the provider's case-id naming) in one run, after readiness and device checks; reports per-case PASSED/FAILED/SKIPPED. Never edits test code or the framework's build files (single tests run via the plugin's `bcRunSuite` Gradle init script).
- `/bc:vnv-sprint-prep` — Run the V&V (Validation & Verification) sprint workflow: check cross-platform parity on the dev board, clone sprint stories onto the V&V board, validate them against requirements and test cases, draft high-level scenarios, drive label state through review, and write the approved scenarios into TestRail as skeleton test cases (phase 7). Dry-run by default; `--apply` writes. Resumable — re-run it to pick up dev answers and reviewer approvals.

## Canonical Artifact Schema

All providers normalize data to this shape before analysis:

```json
{
  "type": "requirement | test_case | board_issue",
  "id": "CWA-REQ-85",
  "title": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "rationale": "...",
  "feature": "Feature Name",
  "status": "Active",
  "linked_ids": ["TC-1234"],
  "raw_fields": {},
  "extended_context": [
    {
      "source": "github",
      "url": "https://github.com/org/repo/blob/main/docs/sds.md",
      "locator": { "owner": "org", "repo": "repo", "path": "docs/sds.md", "ref": "main", "anchor": null },
      "content": "<markdown verbatim>",
      "fetched_at": "ISO 8601 UTC",
      "referenced_images": [{ "alt": "...", "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/..." }],
      "truncated": false
    }
  ]
}
```

The `extended_context` field is **optional** — populated only when:
- The provider extracted a `_enrichment_urls` transient field from the source (e.g., the Excel sheet has a `github_url` column mapped), AND
- `requirements.enrichment.enabled === true` in `.buddy-council/sources.json`, AND
- The fetch succeeded.

Every downstream skill treats it as optional and reads `description` non-exclusively, so legacy data and disabled-enrichment paths work unchanged.

## Configuration Schema Additions

`.buddy-council/sources.json` supports these additional blocks for richer onboarding and analysis:

- **`requirements.column_mapping`** — maps canonical fields (`id`, `title`, `description`, `rationale`, `status`, `item_type`, `github_url`, `feature`) to actual Excel column names. Set by the `/bc:setup` wizard. When absent, the Excel parser falls back to its legacy positional mode.
- **`requirements.feature_inference`** — `{strategy: "hierarchical_folder" | "column" | "none", folder_item_type: "Folder"}`. Controls how requirements are grouped into features. `/bc:setup` always writes `hierarchical_folder` without asking; the other strategies stay parser-supported for hand-edited configs.
- **`requirements.item_type_filter`** — array of `Item Type` values to include (everything else is ignored). Optional; never written by `/bc:setup` — hand-edit only.
- **`requirements.item_type_exclude`** — array of `Item Type` values to skip even when they carry IDs (e.g. `["Text"]` narrative rows). Written automatically by `/bc:setup` when the sheet's Item Type sample contains `Text`; hand-editable for other types.
- **`requirements.enrichment`** — `{enabled: bool, strategy: "cli" | "mcp", max_doc_chars: int}`. Drives GitHub-doc enrichment when a `github_url` column is mapped.
- **`test_cases.authoring`** — `{template_id, type_id, priority_id, requirement_field, section_strategy, section_root, create_missing_sections}`. What `/bc:vnv-sprint-prep` phase 7 and `/bc:coverage`'s gap-fill offer need in order to *create* cases, as opposed to read them. **`requirement_field`** (default `custom_jama_req_id`) is the custom field this plugin reads to build a test case's `linked_ids` — every created case must populate it **and** the built-in `refs`. Writing only `refs` is a silent failure: the case looks right in TestRail but comes back an orphan, leaving its requirement untested and making the next coverage report worse. Resolved once by `/bc:setup` Step 2a against the live instance, because TestRail takes **ids, not names**, and they differ per instance. `template_id` is the one that bites: it decides which body fields a case has, so a steps-style template is required for `custom_steps_separated` to hold Given/When/Then. `section_strategy` is `"feature"` (folder path from each requirement's feature) or `"fixed"` (everything under `section_root`); `section_root` may be `null`. **Phase 7 skips itself with a visible line when this block is absent** — it must never guess a template.
- **`jira`** — `{base_url, deployment, project_key, default_issue_type, board: {url, id}, pending}`. **Written on every `/bc:setup` run — Step 3 is required, not optional.** `deployment` is `"cloud"` or `"server"`, detected from the host (`*.atlassian.net` → cloud), and decides the auth style. `board.url` is the dev board URL the user pasted and `board.id` the integer parsed out of it; `project_key` comes from that URL, or is derived from the board's first issue when a classic RapidBoard URL omits it. `pending: true` means the connection test failed — `/bc:setup` re-tests and clears it on the next run, analysis commands skip the board source while it is set, and `/bc:validate` refuses to create real tickets. **There is no `cloud_id`**: `mcp-atlassian` is bound to one site by `JIRA_URL`, so no tool takes a site id. The credential lives in `~/.buddy-council/atlassian.env`, never here.
- **`jira.vnv_board`** — `{url, id, project_key, discriminator}`. The V&V team's board, used by `/bc:vnv-sprint-prep`. Optional in `/bc:setup` (unlike the dev board) because `/bc:vnv-sprint-prep` can collect it itself. **It may share a project with the dev board** — one project with two boards is a normal Jira layout, and everything here is addressed by board id. Only a duplicate board **id** is refused. When the projects match, `discriminator` (`{kind: "label"|"component"|"issue_type"|"sprint", value, confidence, sampled_at}`) records what the V&V board's filter keys off, so clones land on it; it is `null` when the V&V board has its own project. `/bc:setup` derives it by sampling both boards and confirms once.
- **`jira.platform`** — `{field_name, field_id, values, require_parity, title_prefix_fallback}`. Drives the cross-platform parity check. `field_name` defaults to `OS`; `field_id` is the resolved custom-field id, cached after first discovery and re-discovered when stale. The title prefix is a fallback only, and any result derived from it is reported as lower-confidence.
- **`jira.vnv_workflow`** — `{reviewer: {account_id, display_name}, approval_phrases, labels}`. Who may approve scenarios and what the **four** pipeline labels are called: `pending_validation` (set at clone) → `pending_questions` → `pending_scenario_validation` → `ready_for_test_cases`. **They are mutually exclusive** — every transition removes the previous pipeline label rather than stacking, while preserving `src-<DEV-KEY>`, the platform label, and anything a human added. A ticket with no pipeline label is treated as `pending_validation`; one with several is repaired to the furthest-along and the repair is reported. `/bc:setup` writes the defaults without asking; hand-edit to rename labels.
- **`automation`** — `{repo_url, framework_root, provider, default_platform, branch_prefix}`. Used by `/bc:automate`. `repo_url` is shared and identifies the framework by git `origin`; `framework_root` is a **per-machine cache** like `plugin_root` — re-validated every run and repaired when stale, never trusted blindly. `provider` is `auto` or a `providers/<name>/` folder holding `framework.md`. **`automation.device_farm`** — `{url, repo_url, root, start_command, log_file, start_timeout_s, device_wait_s}` — gates `/bc:run-automation`: the farm is started if down (after confirmation) and the device connected to this machine must be on `<url>/nodes` with `status: FREE` (green ✅) before Gradle runs. `root` is a per-machine cache like `framework_root`. Never call `/freeAll` or stop the farm; `/free/<id>` only on explicit user yes.
- **`project`** — `{enabled: bool, ignore_dirs: [string], id_patterns: [regex]}`. Controls code mapping for `/bc:onboarding` and `/bc:codemap`. When `enabled` is true and cwd contains code markers, the onboarding agent runs a code-mapping phase between demo and assessment for each feature.
- **`plugin_root`** — absolute path to the plugin's install directory, recorded by `/bc:setup`. Bundled files (MCP servers, the Excel parser) are referenced through it because `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` only resolves under Claude Code, not Copilot CLI. Per-machine; lives only in the git-excluded config, never committed. **It is a cache, not the source of truth**: Claude Code's install path embeds the plugin version, so a stored value goes stale on every update. Runtime shell snippets resolve `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`/`$COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT` first and fall back to `plugin_root`; `/bc:setup` Step 0a re-resolves on every run and silently repairs both `sources.json` and `.mcp.json` when the path drifted. Never add a code path that trusts the stored value without validating it exists.

## V&V Progress Log

`<user-project>/.buddy-council/vnv-progress.json`, written by `/bc:vnv-sprint-prep`. One entry per sprint story:
`{version: 1, sprint, dev_board_id, vnv_board_id, started_at, updated_at, stories: [{dev_key, vnv_key,
platform, platform_source, counterpart, parity, state, concerns, concern_comment_id, concern_posted_at,
scenarios_written_at, scenarios, testrail_case_ids, cases_created_at, approved_by, approved_at,
last_checked_at}]}`. Timestamps are ISO 8601 UTC.

`scenarios` is phase 5's structured output (`{id, title, traces_to, given, when, then, coverage, covered_by,
platform_notes}`), cached here because a Jira description is a **lossy** carrier — `jira_update_issue`
converts markdown to wiki markup on Server/DC, so what phase 5 wrote is not what a later read returns.
Phase 7 reads it from here rather than re-parsing prose. `testrail_case_ids` and `cases_created_at` record
what phase 7 wrote, and are only a secondary guard: phase 7 asks **TestRail** first, via
`testrail_get_cases_by_refs` on the dev key.

**Jira labels are the source of truth, not this file.** `state` mirrors the ticket's pipeline label; when
they disagree the next run follows Jira and repairs the file. The log exists to remember *why* a ticket is
where it is (which concerns were raised, when, and who approved) — never to decide where it is.

Lives inside `.buddy-council/`, kept out of git via the repo-local `.git/info/exclude`, like the onboarding log.

## Progress Log Schema Additions

`<user-project>/.buddy-council/onboarding-progress.json` `features[i]` now supports one additional optional field:

- **`code_mapping`** — `{computed_at: ISO 8601 UTC, git_sha: string|null, files: [{path, role}], flow: string, requirement_locations: [{req_id, files: [{path, lines}]}], notes: [string]}`. Written by the `map-feature-to-code` skill. Cached with surgical SHA-diff invalidation when the codebase is a git repo. Stays inside `.buddy-council/`, which is kept out of git via the repo-local `.git/info/exclude`, so it never reaches the team's repo.
